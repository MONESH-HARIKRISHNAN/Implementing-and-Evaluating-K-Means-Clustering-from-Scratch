K-MEANS FROM SCRATCH PROJECT – REQUIREMENTS (TXT)

1) Core Objective
- Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch.

- Use ONLY NumPy for the clustering logic (do not use sklearn.cluster.KMeans).
2) Dataset Requirement
- Create a synthetic 2D dataset using NumPy.
- The set of data provided must have distinct clusters. Recommended: 3 to 5 clusters (e.g., 4 clusters).

3) Implementation Requirements for K-Means Clustering
Your code must include the full K-Means loop:
A) Initialization
- Randomly initialize K centroids (select K points from the dataset).
B) Assignment Step
- Assign a point to the class of its closest centroid.
C) Update Step
- Recalculate each centroid as the mean of all points associated with that cluster.
D) Iteration + Convergence
- Repeat the assignment + update until:
- centroids stop changing, OR
- a tolerance threshold is reached, OR
- max iterations is reached.
E) Edge Case Handling (Recommended)
- If the cluster is empty, reinitialize the centroid of the cluster.

4) Experiments With Different K Values
Run your K-Means implementation for:
K = 2, 3 ,4 ,5 ,6

5) Model Evaluation Requirement
- Calculate Silhouette Score for each K.
- You may:
- implement Silhouette Score manually, OR
- use sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score – ONLY
- Do NOT use sklearn for the clustering algorithm itself.

6) Visualization Requirements
A) Dataset Visualization
- Plot the data set that was generated.
B) Silhouette Score Plot
- Plot Silhouette Score vs K (Line Plot).
C) Final Cluster Visualization
- Plot clustered points for the best K.
- Show the centroids on the plot (for example, using the X marker).

7) Interpretation/ Written Analysis
Your submission should be accompanied by a brief description explaining:
How the clustering changes when K is small (underfitting).
The way that the clustering changes when K is large-over-segmentation.
Which K is best based on highest Silhouette Score.
- How Silhouette Score relates to the visual clustering result.
