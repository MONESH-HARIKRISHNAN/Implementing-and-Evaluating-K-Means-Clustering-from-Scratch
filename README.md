# Implementing-and-Evaluating-K-Means-Clustering-from-Scratch
This project implements K-Means clustering from scratch using NumPy. A synthetic 2D dataset with clear clusters is generated, then centroids are initialized, points are assigned by Euclidean distance, and centroids updated iteratively. Results for K=2–6 are evaluated using Silhouette Score and visualized to find the optimal K.
